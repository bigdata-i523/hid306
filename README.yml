        The Internet of Things, or IoT, is all about data from 
        connected devices. Millions of consumer and industrial 
        devices drive IoT growth and challenge with data
        volume and variety. Big Data Analytics helps combing 
        through these high volumes of complex IoT data into 
        meaningful business insights.

        The Deep Learning is unique in machine learning algorithms 
        to analyze supervised and unsupervised datasets. Big Data 
        challenges like high volumes, multi-dimensionality and 
        feature engineering are well addressed using 
        Deep Learning algorithms. Deep Leaning, with edge and 
        distributed mesh computing, is best suited to handle 
        IoT Analytics of millions of sensors producing 
        petabytes of time-series data.
