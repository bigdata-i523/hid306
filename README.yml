        The Internet of Things, or IoT, is all about data from
        connected devices.  Millions of consumer and industrial
        devices drive IoT growth and challenge with data volume and
        variety. Big Data Analytics helps combing through these high
        volumes of complex IoT data into meaningful business insights.

        The Deep Learning is unique in machine learning algorithms to
        analyze supervised and unsupervised datasets. Big Data
        challenges like high volumes, multi-dimensionality and feature
        engineering are well addressed using Deep Learning
        algorithms. Deep Leaning, with edge and distributed mesh
        computing, is best suited to handle IoT Analytics of millions
        of sensors producing petabytes of time-series data.

        Apply exploratory data analysis and implement various
        advanced supervised machine learning algorithms to predict
        neighborhood housing sale prices found in the sample test dataset.
        Compare the predicted models and results from these advanced
        supervised algorithms. Apply ensembled model to achieve
        better predictions, hence get good score in kaggle competition.
