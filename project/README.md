# Predicting Housing Prices - Kaggle Competition

Apply exploratory data analysis and implement various advanced supervised machine learning algorithms to predict neighborhood housing sale prices found in the sample test dataset. Compare the predicted models and results from these advanced supervised algorithms. Apply ensembled model to achieve better predictions, hence get good score in kaggle competition.
	
Part of the kaggle competition, two sample data sets are given with 80 attributes (variables) describing various aspects of the residential homes in Ames and Iowa cities. Training dataset contains sale price of the homes, and using this training data set, how accurately we can predict Sale Prices of the homes in the test dataset using preprocessing and thorough data analysis. Many developers used advanced learning algorithms - XGBoost, Lasso and Neural Network, to predict the sale prices in the kaggle competition and achieved better kaggle scores. Kaggle score is a measure to indicate accuracy and the quality of the algorithm. We have applied various exploratory analysis techniques and engineer the features before applying a few advanced supervised learning algorithms.

## Dataset Files:

* train.csv - the training data set with 1460 instances and 81 attributes including Sale Price, the target variable
* test.csv - the test data set with 1459 instances and 80 attributes excluding Sale Price

## List of features

The training and testing sample datasets provided by Kaggle contain the same variables explaining the housing real estate aspects. Training dataset contains the sale price information whereas the testing dataset does not the sale price as that is the target variable we need to predict using supervised machine learning algorithm. Following are the list of variables describing the housing real estate domain. Good understanding of the domain is needed for better exploratory data analysis and to apply the matching machine learning algorithms to the problem space.
